  Thanks a lot to the community group which has helped me clear the exam today and sharing my experience below.
</p><p>
  Exam Prep used
</p><ol>
    <li>
  <p>
  SH
</p>
</li><li>
  <p>
  AR &amp; DM both their udemy (AR for 35 hours course certificate)
</p>
</li><li>
  <p>
  Thirdrock pmp material
</p>
</li><li>
  <p>
  Youtube videos (AR&amp;DM)
</p>
</li><li>
  <p>
  ChatGPT - my best aid. ( complex topics i ask it to explain like to a 10 year old. Flash cards, explain in 3-4 lines) This way it didn‚Äôt overwhelm me with info just got what i needed.
</p>
</li>
  </ol><p>
  My Professional background - 13+ years in IT industry and last 5+ years as a project manager.
</p><p>
  Having said that experience is a baggage of weight when you start preparing because real world experience and PMP are bit different.It takes some time to differentiate both and arrive at a mindset.
</p><p>
  I have been preparing for last 2 months consistently and yeah it has taken a toll on me mentally &amp; physically (sitting long hours) Did 4/5 full mocks in SH. Exam grind is real no matter how much ever you prepare its about the frame of mind and zone you are in helps you .
</p><p>
  Never try to prepare everything and you cannot practically get all answers right.
</p><p>
  Intensity of exam prep got more serious the moment i booked the exam so that helps to keep you having a target.
</p><p>
  Coming to exam
</p><p>
  Appeared in pearson testing centre in person which was a good experience
</p><p>
  If we compare difficulty levels majority was Difficult &amp; moderate , expert i would say only 2/3 but here is the catch you get very less easy as well. So when you compare SH keep score focused on Difficult &amp;Moderate.
</p><p>
  Set 1 &amp; 3 were in the level of difficult and set 2 was moderate. Always 2 close answers were there which took time to crack
</p><ol>
    <li>
  <p>
  drag&amp;drop (Tuckman)
</p>
</li><li>
  <p>
  CPI -2 questions
</p>
</li><li>
  <p>
  8-10( 2 or more option answers)
</p>
</li>
  </ol><p>
  Personally- Everyones challenges are unique and cannot be compared but if someone like me with sleep issues &amp; brain fog challenges, can clear  you too can. with a full time role as PM. Had to push beyond my levels to stay focused.
